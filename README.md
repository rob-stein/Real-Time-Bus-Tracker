#Real Time Bus Tracker

**Project Description:** This project was started based off of the project in my class at MIT. I have refactored the existing code out into separate files, I have also included some styling that was not in the original project. I am also including some fun bus icons instead of just a location marker. I have added a border around the map, a title for the browser tab

**How to Run:** To run this download the project and open the index.html file into your browser.

**Roadmap of future improvements:** additional styling, menu's to change between different transportation authorities. (i.e. switch between boston, detroit, san fransisco, etc...)
**License information:** https://mit-license.org/
